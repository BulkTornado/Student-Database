# Student Database

A simple Python program(or maybe not so simple) that reads the data from a json file, and presents it to the user in a readable format.

Currently, two version have been built, with more versions to come.


## Instructions

- Download the latest version from here: github.com/BulkTornado/Student-Database
-  From here, download the two Python programs and the json file(required)
- Kindly head to the release page to download any other version.


## Data structure

- Depending on the version you are using, the data structure is completely different.
- As such, every version of the program requires it's unique file.
- No version's database is compatible with any other version's Python program.

## Future Ideas

- I would like to change the database yet again in version 3.0, to support class wise segregation.
- This is a major hiccup right now cuz only roll numbers are used to search for a student, and the class and section in the database is used only to make the output nicer :)
- In version 4.0, I would like to introduce the key as a tuple of (School Code(CBSE/ICSE/any other), Board(CBSE/ICSE/any other), School Name), and work from there. Let's see how I will be able to implement that :)
